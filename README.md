# Vim-Conceal

This is a fork off of [this repo by khzaw](https://github.com/khzaw/vim-conceal).
I've forked off of the original because I noticed a lot of good stuff in the forks of the original, and wanted some good place to get them all from.
I might continue to maintain this in the future. Pull requests _very_ welcome! :wink:

Make use of vim's "conceal" feature to replace certain language keywords with unicode characters. Just for pure eyecandy. This does not replace your source code at any point.

Use of a plugin manager like [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) or [NeoBundle](https://github.com/shougo/neobundle.vim) is recommeded for installation. Or you can just simply copy the repesctive syntax file (e.g. `python.vim`) in `~/.vim/after/syntax` folder.
